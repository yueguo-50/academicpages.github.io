<h1>Welcome to Yue Guo (郭月)'s webpage!</h1>

<p>I am a final year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://bime.uw.edu">Biomedical and Health Informatics Department</a> at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. <a href="http://bime.uw.edu/faculty/trevor-cohen/">Trevor Cohen</a>. I am particularly interested in <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> in the medical domain.</p>

<p>Before coming to UW, I was a postdoctoral researcher of the Department of Radiation Oncology and Molecular Radiation Sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, supervised by <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/todd-mcnutt">Todd McNutt</a>. I received my Master of Health Science (MHS) from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, majoring in cancer Epidemiology. I got Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S) degree from Capital Medical University.</p>

First work to controll perturbations in a plain language summarization dataset. We study 15 metrics, from automated metrics to lexical features to LLM-prompts. Turns out simplification is difficult for most metrics! POMME is our solution to this shortage of effective metrics! </td>
