Natural language processing is about automatic analysis and generation of text. The analysis refers to mapping a textual input into a data type that captures some aspects of its meaning. A major ongoing debates in the field of NLP is: how much should NLP system development rely on language data (empiricism) vs. humman knowledge (rationalism)?

Difficulties in NLP: 
- Segmenting text into words.
- Huge number of different surface forms
- Words with multiplw meanings
- Context-specific meanings: latex
- Multiword expressions where multiple words combine to mean something that's not merely the 'sum of the word': make a decision
- New words (covid-19) and changing meanings

Key desiderata for NLP systems:
- Sensitivity to a wide range of the phenomena and constraints in human language
- Generality across different languages, genres, styles, and modalities
- Computational efficiency at construction time and runtime
- Strong formal gurantees (e.g., convergence, statistical efficiency, consistency, etc.)
- High accuracy when judged against expert annotations and/or task-specific performance
- Explainable to human users
